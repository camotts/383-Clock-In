Ok, to get this project started we will be breaking this project into individual parts. I will be assigning each of you and myself tasks to complete.

**Beau:** seed the database with some users and admin

**Cameron and Patrick:** Please work on setting up the the database, views, time-stamping and scaffolding

**Bibidth:** Please work on the Crypto hashing of passwords, and make sure usernames are uniquely enforced

**Daniel:** Please work and set the Authentication Cookies, also use the Authorize attribute to make the website secure.

You all have until Wednesday, 5pm to complete your assignments. If you need more time we can meet on Wednesday at 5pm to discuss the project. I will be in the lab all day to answer any questions you may have.
